This program uses an optional -v option for verbose logging, so to run this program, type 'make' to create the executables, and then type oss (or oss -v) to begin execution.

This program runs for 2 seconds real time.

There are 19 semaphores used to handle signaling between user and master.  Sempahores 1 - 18 are used to have user wait on its request to be fulfilled,
and sempahore 19 is used to make sure that the user processes can't push to the message queue at the same time.

It is very rare that the allocated frame count reaches 90% of the total frames, so I am running the daemon at 50% rather than 90% to make sure it is invoked.
